***Data Mining Project***


_This project has been developed by a group of students and me. 
USTHB, M2, SII for 2020/2021_



Data mining is an approach that helps to understand and extract relevant, useful, understandable and correct information that meets a defined need from a collection of data. In the field of Data mining we have several disciplines, such as machine learning, visualization methods, statistics, etc. (Jiawei Han, 2006).


The project is divided into two parts :

1. *Part one :* This first part of the project is devoted to the exploratory study of the data set that we are going to manipulate. The report is structured in three stages the first consists of a detailed representation of the data set that we will use "Thyroid dataset", giving a description of the data, the nature of the attributes, etc. We then move on to a second step which consists of an equally detailed and descriptive visualization of the values ​​of each attribute, in order to deduce the descriptive characteristics of the data (the mean, the median, etc.). We will also give a graphical visualization of the different attributes such as boxplots, scatterplots, and histograms. Finally, in a third step we present the implementation and testing part of the developed application, we present in some screenshots the operation of the application as well as a representation of the results obtained for each step already defined.

2. *Part two :* 

    a. Extract Frequent patterns and association rules by first programming a simple discretization algorithm, then implement the A-PRIORI algorithm and apply it to the instances of the dataset.

    b. Program the K-means, K-medoids and CLARANS algorithms and apply them to the Dataset instances.


And finally a user interface has been add with javaFX to visualize all the functionality developed.
